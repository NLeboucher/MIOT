# Introduction*
# Abstract
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing new propulsion technologies that do not rely on fossil fuels. One such technology is ion propulsion, which uses electric fields to accelerate ions to generate thrust. While ion thrusters have been used primarily in space, recent studies have shown that they can also be useful on Earth, replacing conventional propellers in certain applications. This tutorial will provide an overview of the theory of ion propulsion, a brief history of its development, and a step-by-step guide to building a low-power ion thruster using 3D printing, PCB milling, and soldering skills.

# Context
Inspired by the [Plasma Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrEBoPYS4ns), this project focuses on using ion thruster technology to produce wind for the AOI project and replace its propellers. While most ion thrusters are used in space, there are already multiple ion thrusters made for Earth use cases, such as the MIT plane and Roswell flight, which rely on high tensions of + and -80kv.

# Overview of Ion Propulsion
Ion propulsion is a type of electric propulsion that uses electric fields to accelerate ions to generate thrust. Ion thrusters are used in space to provide propulsion for spacecraft, and they are also used on Earth for applications such as attitude control and station-keeping. Ion thrusters are different from conventional chemical rockets in that they do not use propellant to generate thrust. Instead, they use electric fields to accelerate ions to produce thrust. This is similar to how a Tesla coil produces a spark, but instead of using a spark gap, ion thrusters use an electric field to accelerate ions to produce thrust. Ion thrusters are also different from conventional electric thrusters in that they do not use a propellant to generate thrust. Instead, they use electric fields to accelerate ions to produce thrust. This is similar to how a Tesla coil produces a spark, but instead of using a spark gap, ion thrusters use an electric field to accelerate ions to produce thrust.

# State of the Art

The concept of ion propulsion was first proposed in 1906 by Robert Goddard, but it was not until the 1960s that the first ion thrusters were developed for space applications. The first successful ion thrusters were developed by NASA's Glenn Research Center in the late 1960s, and these early designs paved the way for further developments in ion propulsion technology.[^3]
One of the earliest ion thrusters was the SERT-1 thruster, which was developed by NASA in the 1960s. This thruster used mercury as a propellant and demonstrated the basic principles of ion propulsion. However, it had a low thrust-to-weight ratio and limited operating life.[^3]
In the 1970s, NASA developed the NSTAR ion thruster, which used xenon gas as a propellant. This thruster was much more efficient than the earlier designs and had a higher thrust-to-weight ratio. The NSTAR thruster was first used on the Deep Space 1 mission in 1998 and has since been used on several other spacecraft, including NASA's Dawn mission to study Vesta and Ceres.[^3]
In the 1990s, the European Space Agency (ESA) developed the High-Efficiency Multistage Plasma Thruster (HEMP-T), which used a different type of ionization process than earlier designs. The HEMP-T thruster was more efficient and had a longer operating life than earlier designs.[^3]
In the early 2000s, NASA developed the Evolutionary Xenon Thruster (NEXT), which was based on the NSTAR design but had several improvements. The NEXT thruster had a higher thrust-to-weight ratio and was more efficient than the NSTAR thruster. It has since been used on several missions,[^4] including NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission to study the asteroid Bennu.
One of the most recent developments in ion propulsion is the Dual-Stage 4-Grid (DS4G) ion thruster, which was developed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in the early 2010s. The DS4G thruster is more efficient and has a higher thrust-to-weight ratio than earlier designs. It has been tested on several spacecraft, including NASA's DART mission to deflect an asteroid and the Psyche mission to study a metal-rich asteroid.[^5]
The Micro-Cathode Arc Thruster (µCAT) has demonstrated several impressive performance characteristics for its size and power requirements.
The specific impulse (a measure of how efficiently a thruster uses propellant) of the µCAT has been measured at around 1600 seconds for oxygen propellant, which is higher than other low-power thrusters like cold gas thrusters and electrostatic thrusters.
The maximum thrust produced by the µCAT has been measured at around 40 micro-Newtons, which is enough to provide attitude control and station-keeping for small spacecraft.
However, despite the many improvements made in ion propulsion technology over the years, there are still several challenges that need to be addressed. One of the main challenges is the high power requirements of ion thrusters, which limits their use on smaller spacecraft. 
The MIT has made a plane as well as a buisness Roswell flight. They rely on high tensions(+ and -80kv). [^1] [^2]

This project will focus on using this technology to produce wind for the AOI project, to replace its propellers and help miniaturize the project. 


# Building a Low-Power Ion Thruster

To build a low-power ion thruster, you will need to 3D print 8 cathodes and anodes, and solder a circuit board. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1    3D print 4 arcs.

2    Fix the copper cables onto the cathodes using hot glue to make two cathodes.

3    Glue the arcs onto the aluminum foil and fix them on a plastic board to make two anodes.

4    Mill a circuit board using the provided schematic.

5    Solder the components onto the circuit board, including the resistors and LED.

6    Connect the circuit board to the cathodes and anodes using electronic cables.

7    Apply high voltage to the anodes and cathodes to create the ion wind.

Note: Be careful when working with high voltages!

# Conclusion

Ion thrusters offer a promising alternative to conventional propulsion systems, particularly for in-space maneuvers. However, recent studies have also shown their potential for Earth-based applications. This tutorial has provided an overview of ion propulsion, a brief history of its development, and a step-by-step guide to building a low-power ion thruster using 3D printing, PCB milling, and soldering skills. While the process may require some trial and error, particularly when drilling the aluminum sheets to make the anodes, this project demonstrates the possibilities of ion thruster technology for Earth-based applications and its potential to revolutionize propulsion systems.
